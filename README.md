dissertation
============

This repository is for my PhD dissertation in Engineering Education at Purdue University. I'm looking at "engineering and technology faculty as learners," and using faculty narratives about design curriulum revision as my data. My lens is a poststructuralist one, meaning that I draw on a patchwork of theoretical frameworks to see my data from as many different and contradictory lens as possible.
